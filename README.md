# Alias Reloaded (Minecraft rel-1.12.2) Full SRC Code

This has the full client + minecraft src code for version 1.12.2 included since there are callouts under the main game functions (albeit I think only a couple).

I have not worked on this in 5 years; however, this is the project that convinced me to switch majors from Chemical Engineering to Computer Science. 

The Java version required is very old and I do not have time to mess with this; otherwise, I would have gone and made an updated video. 
Uploading here for my portfolio. This is available for anyone to use.

Client theme is original. At some point I will try to re-compile these into functional jar versions to run in the official launcher; but for now sit on my external drive and now here. 

Not writing anything else in the readme at the moment because I dont remember everything that was added; but, it did have the following few things I remember.

Kill Aura PVP Bypasses, Scaffolding PVP bypass, Accout Switchers, etc.
